## Creation
After trying github pages, dig into the jekyll documentation and reading a lot on markdown, rmarkdown and blogdown, I choose to build the website using blogdown.

Since I don't have that much content to add for now I was wondering if a simple site using rmarkdown was better suited for me...

More to follow, maybe a clean article and some content ;)

Cheers
