<div id="creation" class="section level2">
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>After trying github pages, dig into the jekyll documentation and reading a lot on markdown, rmarkdown and blogdown, I choose to build the website using blogdown.</p>
<p>Since I don’t have that much content to add for now I was wondering if a simple site using rmarkdown was better suited for me…</p>
<p>More to follow, maybe a clean article and some content ;)</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
